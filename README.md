# Marc_to_bib
This is the dumb version that is looking to be a single page "one button" type application with an html file and a php file. It will query against a Sierra database and figure out which bibs go along with which marcs. Marcs are related to libraries, as are bibs. I don't know...I just write the PHP.

This version is to be a simple version. The VueJS and Laravel pilots for these apps are in the works, and this (like the others on here so far) are framework-asbent throwaways. 

It is inadvisable to use this code. Inputs are sanitized, but not to the extent that they should be.
